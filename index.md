## Overview
Rice Cooker Recipes creates a way for students (on-campus or off) to learn and share recipes that:

Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a rice cooker).
Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
Suit local taste sensibilities.
Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc) and maybe by rating/cost of meal.
Have an estimated cost per serving.
Has an estimated number of servings per recipe.
Has an estimate of how long it takes to make.

## Approach
Students are typically just learning to cook for themselves, have limited kitchen facilities, and do not have time to shop around for ingredients. They are also price-sensitive.

The goal of this site is to help improve the nutritional content and variety of foods eaten by students and help them limit the use of vending machines or fast food products by providing tasty, realistic alternatives.

There are three roles in this system: students, vendors, and admins.

Students can both search for and contribute recipes. Recipes not only include the typical description of how to prepare the food and a picture of the completed food, but also information on where to obtain each ingredient and how much each ingredient costs. The recipe also indicates typical dietary restrictions for students (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)

Information on ingredient price and availability can be contributed either by vendors or by students.

There is also an admin role. Admins can edit all content in the system, remove inappropriate content, and establish users as having the vendor role.
